AI Research Engineer who can GTM. Currently an AI Engineer at [VESSL AI](https://vessl.ai/) 🚀. I'm a generalist across the AI research field — I enjoy going deep wherever the problem takes me.

**Research & Engineering topics I've worked on:**

- **Training & Optimization** — Distributed training systems for object detection, model compression with federated learning
- **LLM** — Interpretability, Mixture of Experts, serving optimization
- **AI Infrastructure** — LLM serving backends, AI platform engineering
- **AI for X** — Education, biology/protein
- **Recently** — VLA finetuning

I love experiencing the 0 → 1 → 100 journey in AI startups, especially in San Francisco. Quite interested in the GTM side of things here.

Studied at **UC Berkeley** as a Master of Development Engineering (AI for Social). Go Bears! 🐻

Outside of work, I love workouts that AI can't do — CrossFit, Hyrox, and running.
